      You may be skeptical if you’ve never tried, heard of, or worked with a
      sous vide. That’s ok! There’s a reason this method is most well-known for
      cooking expensive meats to perfection (think of a succulent filet mignon,
      medium rare edge to edge, then seared for the perfect crust).

      Grilling hamburgers, especially thick, juicy ones, are trickier than
      grilling a steak. Burgers can fall apart, with a charred outside and stay
      raw in the middle. This method slowly and precisely cooks so that it
      reaches the exact optimum temperature and comes out perfectly every time.

      The sous vide hamburger recipe produces a mouthwatering thick, juicy
      burger, and you’re still chargrilling the outside for that deep, rich
      crust.

      As Jason mentioned, great hamburgers start with the right ground beef.
      It’s best to use an 80/20 mix, meaning 20% fat (Jason is sometimes right,
      even a blind squirrel finds a few acorns). Fortunately, we live in Denver,
      where the quality of meat is just incredible, even from Food n Stuff. You
      can go to a butcher and get fancier meat as well. Thankfully, this is cow
      country, so it's hard to get it wrong.

      In terms of cheese and other ingredients, I have my faves, but you
      probably like your burger with particular condiments, and that’s just
      fine. All I’ll say is that the bread and vegetables have to be fresh. A
      freshly baked bun will be better than the fanciest bun that’s sat around
      for a while, any day. Fresh is key.
