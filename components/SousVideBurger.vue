        You may be skeptical if you’ve never tried, heard of, or worked with a
        sous vide. That’s ok! There’s a reason this method is well-known for
        cooking expensive meats to perfection (think of a succulent filet
        mignon, medium rare edge to edge, then seared for the perfect crust).

        Grilling hamburgers, especially thick juicy ones, are trickier than
        grilling a steak. Burgers can fall apart, with a charred outside yet raw
        in the middle. This method slowly and precisely cooks so that it reaches
        the exact optimum temperature and comes out flawless every time.

        The sous vide hamburger recipe produces a mouthwatering luscious burger,
        and we can add spices while it slow cooks for complex but delicate
        flavors. We're also chargrilling that outside for a deep, rich crust.

        As Jason mentioned, great hamburgers start with the right ground beef.
        It’s best to use an 80/20 mix, meaning 20% fat (Jason is sometimes
        right, even a blind squirrel finds a few acorns). Fortunately, we live
        in Denver, where the quality of meat is just incredible, even from Food
        n Stuff. You can go to a butcher and get fancier meat as well.
        Thankfully, this is cow country- it's hard to get it wrong.

        In terms of cheese and other ingredients, I have my faves, but you
        probably like your burger with particular condiments, and that’s just
        fine. All I’ll say is that the bread and vegetables have to be fresh. A
        freshly baked bun will be better than the fanciest bun that’s sat around
        for a while. Fresh is key.
