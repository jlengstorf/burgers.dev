      The smashburger is the original burger. It’s simple, classic, and built
      for flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with a potato bun: buttered, toasted, and smeared with burger sauce
      (think of it as a mix of standard condiments, but with a little extra
      flavor). For a guaranteed great bun, get
      <a href="https://potatorolls.com/products/sandwich-potato-rolls/"
        >Martin's sandwich potato rolls</a
      >. Add a layer of shredded iceberg lettuce on the bottom bun to prevent
      the burger juices from turning the bun into a soggy mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all ground beef is created equal, so take the time to find a good
      butcher. Any 80/20 ground beef will work, but if you want to really make
      an amazing burger, use a trimmed chuck roast and add in pork fatback.
      (This probably means grinding your own meat, which isn't hard, but
      requires special equipment.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For each burger, take two 2.5oz balls of ground beef and smash them onto a
      flat top griddle, then salted and peppered. Really smash them thin, to the
      point that you can see holes in the patty — this is called "lace"
      sometimes, and it creates extra surface area for delicious crispiness.
      Almost all of the cooking happens on this one side to capitalize on the
      Maillard magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the patties are nearly cooked through, flip them and salt and pepper
      the other side. The bottom patty gets a pile of thinly sliced red onions
      (use a mandolin to make these <em>really</em> thin), then both patties get
      a slice of American cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the red onions on top of the patty and under the cheese means they
      soak up some of the juices from the burger, which adds a ton of extra
      flavor and starts cooking them a bit, leading to all the good things of
      fresh onions <em>and</em> all the good things from sauteed onions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why American? Because nothing melts like American cheese, and with a
      smashburger it's important to use the cheese as a binding agent to prevent
      the patties from falling apart. A good smashburger is held together with
      nothing but love and American cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheese will melt quickly, at which point the patty without onions is
      stacked on top of the other, then both are placed on top of the bottom
      bun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top bun gets a smear of burger sauce. Add pickles (for best results,
      use
