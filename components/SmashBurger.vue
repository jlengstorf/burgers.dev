        The smashburger is the original burger. It’s simple, classic, and built
        for flavor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with a potato bun: buttered, toasted, and smeared with burger
        sauce (think of it as a mix of standard condiments, but with a little
        extra flavor). For a guaranteed great bun, get
        <a href="https://potatorolls.com/products/sandwich-potato-rolls/"
          >Martin's sandwich potato rolls</a
        >. Add a layer of shredded iceberg lettuce on the bottom bun to prevent
        the burger juices from turning the bun into a soggy mess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all ground beef is created equal, so take the time to find a good
        butcher. Any 80/20 ground beef will work, but if you want to really make
        an amazing burger, use a trimmed chuck roast and add in pork fatback.
        (This probably means grinding your own meat, which isn't hard, but
        requires special equipment.)
      </p>
      <p>
        For each burger, take two 2.5oz balls of ground beef and smash them onto
        a flat top griddle, then salted and peppered. Really smash them thin, to
        the point that you can see holes in the patty — this is called "lace"
        sometimes, and it creates extra surface area for delicious crispiness.
        Almost all of the cooking happens on this one side to capitalize on the
        Maillard magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the patties are nearly cooked through, flip them and salt and
        pepper the other side. The bottom patty gets a pile of thinly sliced red
        onions (use a mandolin to make these <em>really</em> thin), then both
        patties get a slice of American cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting the red onions on top of the patty and under the cheese means
        they soak up some of the juices from the burger, which adds a ton of
        extra flavor and starts cooking them a bit, leading to all the good
        things of fresh onions <em>and</em> all the good things from sauteed
        onions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why American? Because nothing melts like American cheese, and with a
        smashburger it's important to use the cheese as a binding agent to
        prevent the patties from falling apart. A good smashburger is held
        together with nothing but love and American cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cheese will melt quickly, at which point the patty without onions is
        stacked on top of the other, then both are placed on top of the bottom
        bun.
      </p>
      <p>
        The top bun gets a smear of burger sauce. Add pickles (for best results,
        use
